# DenKrement_plugins


To compile the project "exactly as is", some *Trick specific to Eclipse* is required as described in <main.c>

Templates and Examples for Plugins to run with "DenKrement"

- One "really substantial" Plugin contained: *DenKrement_plugin_predefined__connect_external_Python*

- The two *DenKrement_plugin_network_topology_discovery* & *DenKrement_plugin_SDN_LinkMonitoring* are just dummies. (Currently they need to be present in order for DenKrement to properly start, but they just don't do anything)

Examine "DenKr_essentials" & "DenKrement" for little more Information


As a NOTE: I personally use <Eclipse> as IDE. With this you can Link to one and the same Copy of "DenKr_essentials" from different Projects.
